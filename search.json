    "text": "I am a PhD student in cognitive science/machine learning, researching representations of deep learning models, mechanisms of learning, and how to reduce these to interpretable forms. I work in the Institute for Human-Centered AI located at Helmholtz AI, Munich, Germany.\nI like teaching myself and others about various technical topics. For the same reason, I have been wanting to start a blog for some time, which is why I made this website. I am also a certified instructor with the Software Carpentry and have taught workshops on different computational topics."

Partially because I realised that some of the most interesting, useful, and genuine content Iâ€™ve consumed online has been in the form of blog posts. Partially because I believe itâ€™s good for anyone to have a writing space that is persistent but not too intimidating2. And partially because I want to have more of a voice and get better at writing."
