    "text": "I am a PhD student in cognitive science/machine learning, researching representations of deep learning models, mechanisms of learning, and how to reduce these to interpretable forms. I work in the Institute for Human-Centered AI located at Helmholtz Munich.\nI like teaching myself and others about various technical topics. For the same reason, I am also an instructor with the Software Carpentry and have taught workshops on different computational topics."
