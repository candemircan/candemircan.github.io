## Why am I doing this?

I'm writing this blog post for three reasons really:

1. To test whether all the website setup is working as intended.
2. To justify the existence of this website.
3. To finally commit to writing a blog[^1].

I've been meaning to start writing a blog for a while now. Partially because I realised that some of the most interesting, useful, and genuine content I've consumed online has been in the form of blog posts. Partially because I believe it's good for anyone to have a writing space that is persistent but not too intimidating[^2]. And partially because I want to have more of a voice and get better at writing.

## What will I write about?

I have a few ideas about some technical tutorials, living in Germany, and maybe some more informal writings of my research. I'm curious to see what the composition will look like.

[^2]: Actually, this format, as is putting any content online, is still quite intimidating for me, but it is a decent compromise.
