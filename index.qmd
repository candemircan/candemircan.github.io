I am a PhD student in cognitive science/machine learning, researching representations of deep learning models, mechanisms of learning, and how to reduce these to interpretable forms. I work in the [Institute for Human-Centered AI](https://hcai-munich.com) located at Helmholtz Munich.

I like teaching myself and others about various technical topics. For the same reason, I am also an instructor with the [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org) and have taught workshops on different computational topics.
