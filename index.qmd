I am a PhD student in cognitive science/machine learning, researching representation learning in humans and machines under the supervision of Dr. Eric Schulz in the [Institute for Human-Centered AI](https://cpilab.org) located at  the [Helmholtz AI, Munich Germany](https://www.helmholtz.ai/).

I like teaching myself and others about various technical topics. For the same reason, I have been wanting to start a blog for some time, so here we are. I am also a certified instructor with the [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org) and have taught workshops on different computational topics.
